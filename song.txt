What’s Gonna Be

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think about the old days
Remember where we came from
Reflect on what it took for us to make it this far
From dreaming in a parking lot wasting away
To seas of faces, social status, and a sense of victory in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think you'll miss what's coming next
Can you feel it in your chest?
It's gonna be beautiful
Say what you want about us
[?] shut us down

[Chorus]
With a little bit of faith, a lot of patience
We turned this could be into something amazing
And I know what's gonna be
We had a lot of dreams, a little bit of godsend
Never could've dreamed where life would take us back then
And I know what's gonna be

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think about the future, imagine how it's gonna feel
To picture everything we dreamed of coming to pass
Got envisions how I'm gonna be, forever chasing destiny
Manifested more than we could ever conceive

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think you'll miss what's coming next
Can you feel it in your chest?
It's gonna be beautiful
Say what you want about us
[?] shut us down

[Chorus]
With a little bit of faith, a lot of patience
We turned this could be into something amazing
And I know what's gonna be
We had a lot of dreams, a little bit of godsend
Never could've dreamed where life would take us back then
And I know what's gonna be
[Bridge]
Well the time's come to lay it all on the line
And grow to something more than we had ever seen
We waited all our lives for this day to come
For it all to pay off and become the sum
Of what we have worked to be

[Chorus]
With a little bit of faith, a lot of patience
We turned this could be into something amazing
And I know what's gonna be
We had a lot of dreams, a little bit of godsend
Never could've dreamed where life would take us back then
And I know what's gonna be
And I know what's gonna be
And I know what's gonna be
What's gonna be
